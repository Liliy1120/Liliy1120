### :woman_technologist: About Me :

👋🏽 Hi, my name is Liliana

🎓 Grad of Flatirons Data Science Boot camp (October 2022). I'm currently attending National university to recieve my Masters in Computer Science Grad: Febuary 2024

🌇 Southern California Native, with a passion for analyzing data and telling its story so that it helps grow your business

💻 I’m a Data Analyst, Engineer and Educator. I have always been very analytical and love to know the "how" and "why" of everything! I love what technology has and can do to change the world 🌎 or even just one life at a time, Medical tech to Educational tech. We are all users yet struggle to really capture what end users need. I have studied UX design and would like to use my knowledge in UX, analytical, and engineering skills to solve problems using data. After all data tells a story! 

💪🏽 My skills involve communicating and educating small and large groups, analyzing data to make informed decisions, data cleaning and data visualization, Pandas, NumPy, Matlotlib/Seaborn for Data Visualization, Git/GitHub, SQL, Accessing Data through APIs, and Web Scraping. 

🏔 Other than being a student you can find me hanging out with my husband and fur babies, or serving at church.
